  abstract = {We recently developed a new method random-intercept accelerated failure time model with Bayesian additive regression trees (riAFT-BART) to draw causal inferences about population treatment effect on patient survival from clustered and censored survival data while accounting for the multilevel data structure. The practical utility of this method goes beyond the estimation of population average treatment effect. In this work, we exposit how riAFT-BART can be used to solve two important statistical questions with clustered survival data: estimating the treatment effect heterogeneity and variable selection. Leveraging the likelihood-based machine learning, we describe a way in which we can draw posterior samples of the individual survival treatment effect from riAFT-BART model runs, and use the drawn posterior samples to perform an exploratory treatment effect heterogeneity analysis to identify subpopulations who may experience differential treatment effects than population average effects. There is sparse literature on methods for variable selection among clustered and censored survival data, particularly ones using flexible modeling techniques. We propose a permutation-based approach using the predictor's variable inclusion proportion supplied by the riAFT-BART model for variable selection. To address the missing data issue frequently encountered in health databases, we propose a strategy to combine bootstrap imputation and riAFT-BART for variable selection among incomplete clustered survival data. We conduct an expansive simulation study to examine the practical operating characteristics of our proposed methods, and provide empirical evidence that our proposed methods perform better than several existing methods across a wide range of data scenarios. Finally, we demonstrate the methods via a case study of predictors for in-hospital mortality among severe COVID-19 patients and estimating the heterogeneous treatment effects of three COVID-specific medications. The methods developed in this work are readily available in the R package riAFTBART.},

  abstract = {Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) is a non-parametric method to approximate functions. It is a black-box method based on the sum of many trees where priors are used to regularize inference, mainly by restricting trees' learning capacity so that no individual tree is able to explain the data, but rather the sum of trees. We discuss BART in the context of probabilistic programming languages (PPL), i.e., we present BART as a primitive that can be used as a component of a probabilistic model rather than as a standalone model. Specifically, we introduce the Python library PyMC-BART, which works by extending PyMC, a library for probabilistic programming. We showcase a few examples of models that can be built using PyMC-BART, discuss recommendations for the selection of hyperparameters, and finally, we close with limitations of our implementation and future directions for improvement.},

  abstract = {Individualized treatment rules can improve health outcomes by recognizing that patients may respond differently to treatment and assigning therapy with the most desirable predicted outcome for each individual. Flexible and efficient prediction models are desired as a basis for such individualized treatment rules to handle potentially complex interactions between patient factors and treatment. Modern Bayesian semiparametric and nonparametric regression models provide an attractive avenue in this regard as these allow natural posterior uncertainty quantification of patient specific treatment decisions as well as the population wide value of the prediction-based individualized treatment rule. In addition, via the use of such models, inference is also available for the value of the optimal individualized treatment rules. We propose such an approach and implement it using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees as this model has been shown to perform well in fitting nonparametric regression functions to continuous and binary responses, even with many covariates. It is also computationally efficient for use in practice. With Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, we investigate a treatment strategy which utilizes individualized predictions of patient outcomes from Bayesian Additive Regression Trees models. Posterior distributions of patient outcomes under each treatment are used to assign the treatment that maximizes the expected posterior utility. We also describe how to approximate such a treatment policy with a clinically interpretable individualized treatment rule, and quantify its expected outcome. The proposed method performs very well in extensive simulation studies in comparison with several existing methods. We illustrate the usage of the proposed method to identify an individualized choice of conditioning regimen for patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation and quantify the value of this method of choice in relation to the optimal individualized treatment rule as well as non-individualized treatment strategies.},

  abstract = {Background{\enspace} It is unclear whether an implantable cardioverter-\-defibrillator (ICD) is generally beneficial in survivors of out-o\- f-\-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Objective{\enspace} We studied the association between ICD implantation prior to discharge and survival in patients with cardiac aetiology or initial shockable rhythm in OHCA. Design{\enspace} We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the Swedish Registry for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Treatment associations were estimated using propensity scores. We used gradient boosting, Bayesian additive regression trees, neural networks, extreme gradient boosting and logistic regression to generate multiple propensity scores. We selected the model yielding maximum covariate balance to obtain weights, which were used in a Cox regression to calculate HRs for death or recurrent cardiac arrest. Participants{\enspace} All cases discharged alive during 2010 to 2020 with a cardiac aetiology or initial shockable rhythm were included. A total of 959 individuals were discharged with an ICD, and 2046 were discharged without one. Results{\enspace} Among those experiencing events, 25\% did so within 90 days in the ICD group, compared with 52\% in the other group. All HRs favoured ICD implantation. The overall HR (95\%\,CI) for ICD versus no ICD was 0.38 (0.26 to 0.56). The HR was 0.42 (0.28 to 0.63) in cases with initial shockable rhythm; 0.18 (0.06 to 0.58) in non-\-shockable rhythm; 0.32 (0.20 to 0.53) in cases with a history of coronary artery disease; 0.36 (0.22 to 0.61) in heart failure and 0.30 (0.13 to 0.69) in those with diabetes. Similar associations were noted in all subgroups. Conclusion{\enspace} Among survivors of OHCA, those discharged with an ICD had approximately 60\% lower risk of death or recurrent cardiac arrest. A randomised trial is warranted to study this further.},

There is an urgent need for methods that can overcome these challenges to model this complex data. At present there is no cure for dementia and no treatment that can successfully change the course of the disease. Machine learning models that can predict the time until a patient develops dementia are important tools in helping understand dementia risks and can give more accurate results than traditional statistical methods when modelling high-dimensional, heterogeneous, clinical data. This work compares the performance and stability of ten machine learning algorithms, combined with eight feature selection methods, capable of performing survival analysis of high-dimensional, heterogeneous, clinical data. We developed models that predict survival to dementia using baseline data from two different studies. The Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of 1037 participants, aged 70--90~years, that aims to determine the effects of ageing on cognition. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal study aimed at identifying biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease. Using the concordance index as a measure of performance, our models achieve maximum performance values of 0.82 for MAS and 0.93 For ADNI.},

Such data are often analyzed using Cox models for the cause-specific hazard function or Fine and Gray models for the subdistribution hazard. In practice, regression relationships in competing risks data are often complex and may include nonlinear functions of covariates, interactions, high-dimensional parameter spaces and nonproportional cause-specific, or subdistribution, hazards. Model misspecification can lead to poor predictive performance. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach: flexible prediction modeling of competing risks data using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). We study the simulation performance in two-sample scenarios as well as a complex regression setting, and benchmark its performance against standard regression techniques as well as random survival forests. We illustrate the use of the proposed method on a recently published study of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.},

More importantly, as more variables are analyzed, models tend to over-fit (i.e., the model provides good predictions on the studied data but performs poorly on other data).               Recently two methods have been proposed for handling multivariate analysis of high-dimensional data. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) minimizes the number of Cox regression coefficients, favoring models that are parsimonious and less likely to over-fit. LASSO is computationally efficient and capable of handling correlated variables. Random Survival Forests (RSF) combines multiple decision trees built on randomly selected subsets of variables. This enables the evaluation of all variables, even in the presence of significant correlations or missing data, and reduces over-fitting. Few studies have evaluated these models on realistic datasets. This study compared the performance of LASSO and RSF to that of the traditional Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) with respect to their ability to predict survival based on high dimensional reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients.                                         Methods               Our data were derived from previous work to define the role of the pathway activation in AML using a custom made RPPA onto which were printed leukemia enriched cells from 511 newly diagnosed AML patients collected between 1992 and 2007. The RPPA was probed with 231 strictly validated antibodies. Data were normalized and analysis was performed for the 415 subjects that underwent therapy at MD Anderson. The dataset also included 38 clinical variables.               We removed cases with a documented survival of less than 4 weeks and imputed a small number of sporadically missing values by random sampling with replacement. We generated LASSO, RSF, and CoxPH models using R. We built RSF models using 1000 trees and 10 random split points. We then identified key features using the RSF max-subtree and the glmnet cross validation methods. We built an RSF and Cox models to these variables only. Models were trained on a bootstrap sample of the size of the dataset, randomly sampled with replacement, and tested on the un-sampled remaining cases. The process was repeated for 50 iterations and results were averaged. We report Harrell's concordance index (C-Index) and the Brier score for model performance. Harrell's C-Index is a pairwise comparison of all observations in the testset. It evaluates the probability of erroneously assigining longer survival time to one case over the other. Brier score calculates the difference between the predicted and observed probabilities. It evaluates how well the model fits the entire dataset.                                         Results               Cox regression with LASSO regularization had the best performance based on both Brier score and C-Index (Table 1               and figure 1). For the complete dataset Cox regression models did not converge even when using forward feature selection. Cox regression following feature selection based on RSF had inferior performance compared to other methods.                                         Conclusions               LASSO and RSF allow for mutlivariate analysis of high-dimensional data that would have not been possible otherwise. LASSO regularization outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and to select features for traditional Cox models. Using the latter approach has great appeal as traditional Cox models allow easy interpertation of the hazard associated with individual variables. Differences in Brier scores are more pronounced than C-Indexes, possibly indicating a tendency of LASSO regularization to overfit the data compared to RSF.

  abstract = {Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) provide a framework for flexible nonparametric modeling of relationships of covariates to outcomes. Recently, BART models have been shown to provide excellent predictive performance, for both continuous and binary outcomes, and exceeding that of its competitors. Software is also readily available for such outcomes. In this article, we introduce modeling that extends the usefulness of BART in medical applications by addressing needs arising in survival analysis. Simulation studies of one-sample and two-sample scenarios, in comparison with long-standing traditional methods, establish face validity of the new approach. We then demonstrate the model's ability to accommodate data from complex regression models with a simulation study of a nonproportional hazards scenario with crossing survival functions and survival function estimation in a scenario where hazards are multiplicatively modified by a highly nonlinear function of the covariates. Using data from a recently published study of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we illustrate the use and some advantages of the proposed method in medical investigations.
