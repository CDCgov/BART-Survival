## Overview

``BART-Survival`` is a Python package that supports discrete-time Survival analyses using the non-parametric machine learning algorithm, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). ``BART-Survival`` combines the performance of the BART algorithm from the [PyMC-BART](https://www.pymc.io/projects/bart/en/latest/) library with the proper structural formatting required to complete the end-to-end Survival analysis. 

``BART-Survival``'s performance is comparative to other Survival regression methods, such as Cox Proportional Hazard and AFT models, in low-complexity settings and can outperform these other models in high-complexity settings were their respective assumptions may fail (i.e. proportional hazard assumption, linearity assumptions). Additionally, the Bayesian framework provides easily accessible uncertainty intervals and capabilities to extensively interrogate trained model.

The ``BART-Survival`` library provides a simple API for completing standard Survival analysis, as well as allowing exposure to the underlying PyMC code providing accessibility to extend the ``BART-Survival`` library when necessary.

This repository contains the source code and documentation for the `BART-Survival` package as well as [example](https://github.com/CDCgov/BART-Survival/tree/main/examples/) notebooks. 

``BART-Survival`` can be installed directly from PyPi 
```python
pip install `BART-Survival`==0.1.1
```
Or as accessed from this repository.

### Demonstration

Brief demo of the basic steps.

```python
from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi
from bart_survival import surv_bart as sb
import numpy as np

######################################
# Load rossi dataset from lifelines
rossi = load_rossi()
names = rossi.columns.to_numpy()
rossi = rossi.to_numpy()

######################################
# Transform data into 'augmented' dataset
# Requires creation of the training dataset and a predictive dataset for inference
trn = sb.get_surv_pre_train(
    y_time=rossi[:,0],
    y_status=rossi[:,1],
    x = rossi[:,2:],
    time_scale=7
)

post_test = sb.get_posterior_test(
    y_time=rossi[:,0],
    y_status=rossi[:,1],
    x = rossi[:,2:],
    time_scale=7
)

######################################
# Instantiate the BART models
# model_dict is defines specific model parameters
model_dict = {"trees": 50,
    "split_rules": [
        "pmb.ContinuousSplitRule()", # time
        "pmb.OneHotSplitRule()", # fin
        "pmb.ContinuousSplitRule()",  # age
        "pmb.OneHotSplitRule()", # race
        "pmb.OneHotSplitRule()", # wexp
        "pmb.OneHotSplitRule()", # mar
        "pmb.OneHotSplitRule()", # paro
        "pmb.ContinuousSplitRule()", # prio
    ]
}
# sampler_dict defines specific sampling parameters
sampler_dict = {
            "draws": 200,
            "tune": 200,
            "cores": 8,
            "chains": 8,
            "compute_convergence_checks": False
        }
BSM = sb.BartSurvModel(model_config=model_dict, sampler_config=sampler_dict)

#####################################
# Fit Model
BSM.fit(
    y =  trn["y"],
    X = trn["x"],
    weights=trn["w"],
    coords = trn["coord"],
    random_seed=5
)

# Get posterior predictive for evaluation.
post1 = BSM.sample_posterior_predictive(X_pred=post_test["post_x"], coords=post_test["coords"])

# Convert to SV probability.
sv_prob = sb.get_sv_prob(post1)

```
