# Summary

`BART-Survival` is a Python package that allows time-to-event (survival) analyses in discrete-time using the non-parametric machine learning algorithm, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). `BART-Survival` combines the performance of the BART algorithm with the complementary data and model structural formatting required to complete the survival analyses. The library contains a convenient application programming interface (API) that allows a simple approach when using the library for survival analyses, while maintaining capabilities for added complexity when desired. The package is intended for analysts exploring use of flexible non-parametric alternatives to traditional (semi-)parametric survival analyses. 

# Statement of need

Survival analyses are a cornerstone of public health and clinical research in such diverse fields as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and infectious diseases [@altman1998; @bradburn2003]. Traditional parametric and semi-parametric statistical methods, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, are commonly employed for survival analyses [@cox1972]. However, these methods have several limitations, particularly when applied to complex data. One major issue is the need for restrictive assumptions, such as proportional hazards and predefined functional forms, which may not hold true in complex, real-world healthcare data [@ishwaran2008; @harrell2015]. Additionally, these methods often struggle with high-dimensional datasets, leading to problems with overfitting, multicollinearity, and dealing with complex interactions [@ishwaran2008; @joffe2013].

More recently, non-parametric machine learning approaches have been introduced to address these limitations by reducing the need for restrictive assumptions and providing increased capabilities for more accurately modeling underlying distributions and complex interactions [@ishwaran2008; @harrell2015]. BART is one such machine learning method that has demonstrated utility in the survival setting through its performance in identifying underlying statistical distributions [@chipman2010; @sparapani2021]. BART offers flexibility in modeling complex relationships and interactions within the data without requiring the specification of a particular functional form [@sparapani2016].

Currently, the only BART survival algorithm readily available exists as part of the `BART` R package, which contains a library of various BART-based approaches in addition to a BART survival analysis application [@sparapani2016; @sparapani2021]. BART-Survival package described here combines the survival analysis approach outlined in the `BART` R package with the foundational Python-based probabilistic programming language library, `PyMC`, and the accompanying BART algorithm from the `PyMC-BART` library.
Our aim in developing `BART-Survival` is to provide accessibility to the BART survival algorithm within the Python programing language. This contribution is beneficial for analysts when Python is the preferred programming language, the analytic workflow is Python-based, or when the R language is unavailable for analyses. Additionally, `BART-Survival` package abstracts away the complexities of the `PyMC` and `PyMC-BART` libraries through use of a pre-specified core model and generalized functionality that can accommodate analyses across various survival settings. The  `BART-Survival` package is intended for public health and clinical professionals and students who are looking for non-parametric alternatives to traditional (semi-)parametric survival analysis, especially for use in large, complex healthcare data and machine learning applications.
