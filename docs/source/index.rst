Welcome to BART-Survival's documentation!
=========================================

BART-Survival is a Python package that allows time-to-event (survival analyses) in discrete-time using the non-parametric machine learning algorithm, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). BART_Survival combines the performance of the BART algorithm from the PyMC-BART library with the complementary data and model structural formatting required to provide a convenient approach to conducting high performance, non-parametric survival analysis.
